Description: Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
 Clang-format is both a library and a stand-alone tool with the goal of
 automatically reformatting C++ sources files according to configurable
 style guides. To do so, clang-format uses Clang's Lexer to transform an
 input file into a token stream and then changes all the whitespace around
 those tokens. The goal is for clang-format to both serve both as a user
 tool (ideally with powerful IDE integrations) and part of other
 refactoring tools, e.g. to do a reformatting of all the lines changed
 during a renaming.

Package: libfuzzer-12-dev
Architecture: linux-any
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, clang-12 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Library for coverage-guided fuzz testing
 LibFuzzer is a library for in-process, coverage-guided, evolutionary fuzzing
 of other libraries.
 .
 LibFuzzer is similar in concept to American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), but it performs
 all of its fuzzing inside a single process. This in-process fuzzing can be
 more restrictive and fragile, but is potentially much faster as there is no
 overhead for process start-up.
 .
 The fuzzer is linked with the library under test, and feeds fuzzed inputs to
 the library via a specific fuzzing entrypoint (aka 'target function'); the
 fuzzer then tracks which areas of the code are reached, and generates mutations
 on the corpus of input data in order to maximize the code coverage. The code
 coverage information for libFuzzer is provided by LLVM's SanitizerCoverage
 instrumentation.

Description: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description: production-quality unwinder
 libunwind is a production-quality unwinder, with platform support for DWARF
 unwind info, SjLj, and ARM EHABI.
 .
 The low level libunwind API was designed to work either in-process (aka local)
 or to operate on another process (aka remote), but only the local path has
 been implemented. Remote unwinding remains as future work.
